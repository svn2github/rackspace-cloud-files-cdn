Stores all of your WordPress media on Rackspace's Cloud Files CDN. Once the file is uploaded, it is deleted from the local server.

== Description ==

Allows any media in your WordPress uploads folder to be uploaded to Rackspace's Cloud Files CDN. ** If you are doing an initial upload, backup your uploads directory first, just in case. Iâ€™ve not had any issues, but wanted to include this disclaimer.

== Installation ==
