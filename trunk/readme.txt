Stores all of your WordPress media on Rackspace's Cloud Files CDN. Once the file is uploaded, it is deleted from the local server.

== Description ==

Allows any media in your WordPress uploads folder to be uploaded to Rackspace's Cloud Files CDN. ** If you are doing an initial upload, backup your uploads directory first, just in case. I’ve not had any issues, but wanted to include this disclaimer.

= Version 0.0.1 =

I've tested this quite thoroughly. Very stable.

== Installation ==

1. Upload plugin to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Backup uploads directory (optional, if doing initial upload)
4. Use it! Save money!

== Screenshots ==

1. Admin page when all files are synced.

2. Admin page when there files that need synced.

3. Admin page while syncing files in real-time.
